# Introduction
As mobile devices and real-time scenarios are becoming more ubiquitous and prevalent, research on mobile visual analytics is extremely urgent. The purpose of mobile visual analytics is to enable entirely new on-device experiences. In the past few years, some effective techniques in mobile visual analytics have been developed to address many challenging issues in many aspects such as real-time detection or segmentation tasks under dynamically changing scenes and computationally constrained resources.

In this tutorial, we first introduce some preliminaries of the tutorial and state-of-the-art approaches in some mobile visual tasks. Then, we present in-depth studies and analyses on the recently developed mobile visual techniques, including efficient backbone network design for mobile usage, rapid vision algorithm study for downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation, and finally the context-aware algorithms under dynamic background for moving cameras. This topic covers two main aspects of mobile visual analytics: methods that can accelerate AI algorithms run for computational resource-constrained devices, and techniques that can leverage the contextual information under dynamic environments for mobile devices.
